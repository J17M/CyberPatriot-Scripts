# CyberPatriot Scripts

This is a collection of old scripts I wrote during highschool when I was first getting into scripting for CyberPatriot.

> Keep in mind that these scripts are when I was younger so these scripts definitely do not follow good coding practices.

## What is Included

* **Linux Hardening Scripts (`.sh`)**:
    * Scripts for securing Ubuntu/Debian firewalls.
    * List all users and admins.
    * List all media files (audio, video).
    * Hardening of SSH server config file.
    * Change read/write permissions for files.
    * Install hardening tools (ckrootkit, rkhunter).
    * Hardened password policies.
